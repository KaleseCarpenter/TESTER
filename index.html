        <div class="myInfoContainer">

            <p>
                I am from northern Ohio. <br><br>
                I enjoy going to live shows.<br><br>
                I want to travel the wotld for a living, own an organic farm, buy a boat and have a home right in front of the beach.<br><br>
                It has always been a dream of mine to to learn coding languages so that I can develop apps and explore different avenues within the music industry. <br><br>
                I was introduced to HTML by Myspace and it motivated me to go to college in San Francisco for Web Design and New Media / Music Production and Sound.<br><br>
                I am on a journey to become the highest version of myself. I am falling in love with my journey. I look forward to financial freedom and having more time to spend with family and friends.
